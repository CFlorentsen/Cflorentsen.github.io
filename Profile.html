<h2>PhD from University of Copenhagen, currently hired as a PostDoc at the Niels Bohr Institute. Specialized in biophysics and comfortable working at the crossroads of physics, optics, biophotonics, chemistry, molecular biology, and medicine. 
        I can contribute with excellent skills in protein research, data analysis, programming and presentation of scientific data with a unique and versatile insight into natural sciences at the nanoscale. 
        I have specialized in biophysics and nanomedicine, with a focus on protein research and drug delivery and I have a wide range of skills in my scientific toolbox. 
        I also have competencies from student supervision and project management as well as an R&D engineering background.</h2>
